Angular2 Starter Task
Develop a simple Angular2 application where user can upload images via a simple drag and
drop or uploading form.
Pictures should be saved on a local directory.
Display the uploaded images in a grid system. Feel free to use any CSS options to make the
design.
In order to make it easy, build your project on top of this one, by extending the funcitonalities of
this web application with a new menu entry called: "Artrium"
